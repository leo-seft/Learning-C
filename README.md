1. Getting Started with C#
   This section covers the following topics:

- Introduction to C# and .NET Framework
- Writing Your First C# Program
- Basic Syntax and Data Types
- Variables, Constants, and Data Types in C#

By completing these tasks, you should have a good understanding of the basics of C# programming, including its syntax and data types, how to write a simple C# program, and how to use variables and constants in your code.

Tasks:
Introduction to C# and .NET Framework

- Research what C# is and its history.
  History:
  C# is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. It was designed in 1999/2000 and it became part of the .NET framework in 2000.
  It was introduced as part of the .NET initiative and is widely used for building a variety of applications, including web, desktop, and cloud-based applications.

- Understand the .NET framework and how it relates to C#.
  .NET:
  The .NET Framework is a platform for developing Windows-based applications, and it was introduced in 2002. It also allows cross-language interoperability which means code can be written in different .NET languages and work with no issues. C# was built to be one of the primary languages of the .NET framework.

- Learn about the advantages of using C# and the .NET framework for programming.
  Advantages of C# and .NET:
  C# is a fully object-oriented language which supports encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, this makes it easier to write reusable and maintainable code.
  C# is very versitile as it can be used for: Web, Desktopm, Mobile, Game development and Cloud-based applications
  .NET has tools and frameworks for most application types.
  Applications made on .NET are both scalable and reliable, which makes it very future proof.

Writing Your First C# Program

- Set up your development environment (Visual Studio, VS Code, or other).
  When trying to run my code in Ubuntu I had numerous issues so I switched over to my local computer where I had issues regarding permissions so I had to create files by entering 'dotnet new console -n application name' which then allowed me to run my code. I found that this is because c# is a more secure language than javascript

- Create a new C# project with a .cs file extension.
  please See Day1-MyFirstProgram

- Write a simple "Hello, world!" program in C#.
  please See Day1-MyFirstProgram

- Build and run your program to verify that it works correctly.
  please See Day1-MyFirstProgram
  For it to run I had to use 'dotnet run' in the terminal

Basic Syntax and Data Types

- Print "Hello World" to the console using C#.
  To do this you use 'Console.WriteLine("Hello World!")'
- Learn the basic syntax of the C# programming language.
- Understand C# data types, including integers, floating-point numbers, characters, booleans, and strings.
- Practice creating and using arithmetic operators and expressions.

Variables, Constants, and Data Types in C#

  to declare a variable we do it like this:
  'variable-type variable-name = data'
- Learn the difference between variables and constants in C#.
  The value of a constant can not change but a variable can
- Understand how to declare and initialize variables and constants.
  to declare a constant we do it like this:
  'const variable-type variable-name = data'
  an 'enum' is a group of constants
- Explore the different C# data types in variable declarations and their uses.
- Research C# single and multidimensional array data structures, including useful methods.
- Practice using variables and constants to create variables of different data types in your C# programs.

  If-else statements work the same as JavaScript
  Switch statements work using Case as the if and default as else for example
  'switch(year){
  case 1 :{
  Text
  break
  }
  default:{
  Text
  break
  }
  }'
- Understand how to use logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) in C# conditional statements.

  please see Day3-ConditionalsAndLoops

Functions in C# (creating and calling)

- Learn how to define and call functions in C#.
  'modifiers return-type method-name parameter-list'
  when a method has no return type, it is set to void

  A function is independent and can be called without an object

- Practice writing functions that perform simple tasks like a function that prints out a message when called.

Please see Day5-functions

Passing Arguments to Functions

  void is when you dont expect a new value to return ie just hello but non-void is for when a new value is returned such as 1+1=2

- Practice using functions to perform complex tasks and return values to the main program.

Please see Day5-functions
